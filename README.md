# Hide and Seek Header Plugin

## For Avada by ThemeFusion

This WordPress plugin hides the site header on down scroll events for the Avada theme. Eventually it will hide the header on scroll up or down or both, and it will support other themes.

## Motivation

See the [original Avada forum thread](https://theme-fusion.com/forums/topic/avada-sticky-header-on-scroll-up-only/) where this plugin was conceived.

## Codepen

Kick the tires on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/marklchaves/pen/RwNOVzQ).

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/PLUGINNAME directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.

That's it!
