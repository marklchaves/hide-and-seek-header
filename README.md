# Hide and Seek Header Plugin

## For Avada by ThemeFusion

This WordPress plugin hides the site header on down scroll events for the Avada theme. Eventually it will hide the header on scroll up or down or both (?), and it will support other themes.

## Motivation

See the [original Avada forum thread](https://theme-fusion.com/forums/topic/avada-sticky-header-on-scroll-up-only/) where this plugin was conceived.

## Features

- Hides the sticky header on scroll down **only** as originally requested.
- Defaults to mobile first design. The sticky header is **only** hidden for widths greater and including `800px` (default Avada responsive breakpoint). Support for custom breakpoints is on the [roadmap](https://github.com/marklchaves/hide-and-seek-header/wiki).
- There is fade animation when the sticky header starts being hidden make the transition smooth and natural (i.e., doesn't look like a bug). Support for different animation speeds is on the [roadmap](https://github.com/marklchaves/hide-and-seek-header/wiki).
- Super simple install. Two steps and your done.
- Lightweight&mdash;under 100 KB zipped.

## Installation

1. Drop-in&mdash;manually upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/hide-and-seek-header directory or upload the plugin zip file via your wp-admin **Plugins** > **Add New** > **Upload Plugin**.
2. Activate the plugin through the wp-admin **Plugins** page.

That's it!

This is the recommended and standard WordPress install process. There are many advantages of following this approach such as 2-click install, no coding, no need for FTP, and version update notifications. If you absolutely need to bypass this process, the instructions for _hand-dropping_ the plugin are in the [wiki](https://github.com/marklchaves/hide-and-seek-header/wiki/#hand-drop-instructions).

## Compliance

This plugin follows the [WordPress Plugin Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/). Namely that it cannot be called directly via a public URL, has a unique namespace, and [properly enqueues](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/javascript/enqueuing/) its CSS and JavaScript assets.

## Roadmap

I'll keep an updated wishlist on [the Wiki](https://github.com/marklchaves/hide-and-seek-header/wiki) for this repo.
